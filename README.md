# Data Preprocessing Practices and Projects

This repository contains my practices and projects related to data preprocessing. It includes various techniques for cleaning, preparing, and transforming data for machine learning and data analysis tasks.

## Contents

- Data Cleaning (Handling missing data, outliers, etc.)
- Feature Engineering (Creating new features, encoding categorical variables)
- Data Transformation (Scaling, normalization, encoding)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA and other techniques)
- Complete Preprocessing Pipelines for real-world projects


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-preprocessing.git
   ```

2. Explore the notebooks or scripts to practice different data preprocessing techniques.

3. Modify and reuse the scripts for your own projects.

## Projects
